    "TITLE": "Sobre m칈",
    "SUBTITLE": "Puedes llamarme Nico",
    "DESCRIPTION": "Full stack developer, videogame developer, English teacher, artist, generally curious about everything. Born in London, UK, I've lived in Bilbao since I was 12. I studied Fine Arts at University, and and fell in love with creative coding. Since then, I've gone to study front end, back end, video game development and machine learning, while working as an English teacher. At this point, my favourite art form is code."

  "WORK": {
    "TITLE": "Trabajo",
    "DESCRIPTION": "Here's a showcase of some projects I'm proud of. Since first becoming interested in coding in 2020, I've explored a lot of different fields, trying to find what I have an affinity for and what I'm motivated by (and what I'm not! 游). During this time, I've discovered design patterns and the SOLID principles, which I'm very interested in, and I've also learned a lot about structuring the code of a project. At the same time, I've dived into data structures and algorithms, balancing the study of computer science fundamentals with project based learning. Currently, I'm challenging myself to learn new concepts using just documentation, without courses, to try and maximize learning efficiency, and to become independent of tutorials and courses as much as possible (i.e: escaping tutorial hell)."
